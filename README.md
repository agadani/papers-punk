# papers-punk
Randomly chooses a file from a specified directory and displays it when a new Chrome tab is created. 
Useful for getting through directories of research papers.

Soon to be packaged as a proper extension in the Chrome store when it's a bit more friendly.
Currently, there is no input sanitization.

  // FUTURE TODO: Weight the random by file age.
  // FUTURE TODO: Make it work without turning on the built-in pdf reader
  // FUTURE TODO: Mark as read button.
